        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a junior Front-End Developer with a passion for technology and innovation, transitioning from a background in fashion design. With a Master’s in Textile Design and a Bachelor’s in Garment Technology, I spent years working in design and quality assurance, developing a keen sense of user-first thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. Now, I bring that same attention to detail and creativity to web development, combining technical skills with a strong design sensibility.

          After completing the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate in March 2025, I’ve immersed myself in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, focusing on creating seamless, accessible, and visually compelling digital experiences. My expertise in design tools like Adobe Creative Suite and Figma allows me to translate complex concepts into functional and engaging interfaces.

          My international experiences—having lived in Thailand, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands—have shaped my adaptability and curiosity. I believe that great design and technology should serve people first, which is why I’m passionate about accessibility, intuitive UI, and building experiences that are both beautiful and functional. I’m currently enhancing my skills through online coding platforms (Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp) to build my portfolio, and looking for opportunities to collaborate on real-world projects where I can make an impact with both creativity and code.
